# System Insights FAQ

>Applies To: Windows Server 2019

## How does System Insights relate to Azure Operations Management Suite (OMS)

[Azure Operations Management Suite (OMS)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/operations-management-suite/) is a cloud-based IT management solution, providing operational information across your deployments to help you manage your on-premises and cloud infrastructure. System Insights, in contrast, is a Windows Server feature that introduces local predictive analytics capabilities. Together, these two technologies can help surface predictive analysis across a population of devices:

OMS can key off the events created by System Insights, as System Insights outputs the result of each prediction to the event log. OMS can surface these machine-specific predictions across a fleet of Windows Servers, enabling Azure OMS subscribers to have a unified, intuitive view of these predictions across a group of server instances.


## How does System Insights relate to Windows ML?

Windows ML is a platform that enables developers to import and score pre-trained ML models on Windows devices. These models benefit from hardware acceleration, and they can be scored locally. 

System Insights is a feature in Windows Server 2019 that offers local predictive capabilities together with a complete management experience, including PowerShell and Windows Admin Center integration. **The models behind these System Insights capabilities can leverage Windows ML** to benefit from hardware acceleration and the ability to import models in the [Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX)](https://onnx.ai/) format. 

In Windows Server 2019, the default capabilities don't currently use Windows ML because these capabilities require local training to adapt to the specific datasets of each node. 


## Can I use System Insights for my cluster? 

Yes. System Insights can independently run on each individual failover cluster node, and the capabilities forecast local storage, volume, CPU, and networking usage for each node in a cluster.  If desired, you can collect and surface these machine-scoped forecasts via simple PowerShell scripts for the entire cluster because you can use PowerShell to access the forecast results for each remote machine. 

Note that by default, System Insights storage and volume capacity forecasting predictions are limited to non-clustered storage. This avoids having each cluster node redundantly forecast on clustered storage that is accessible from all nodes of the cluster. We, however, expect to add new functionality to System Insights in a future preview build that could optionally provide storage & volume capacity forecasting on clustered storage (e.g. CSV volumes), from each cluster node where this option is enabled.   


## How expensive is it to run the default capabilities?

Each default capability is relatively inexpensive to run. Each capability will take longer to run as you collect more data, but they typically should complete in a just a few seconds.
