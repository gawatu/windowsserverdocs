# System Insights overview

>Applies To: Windows Server 2019

System Insights is a new feature that introduces predictive analytics natively to Windows Server. These predictive capabilities locally analyze Windows Server system data, such as performance counters or ETW events, helping IT administrators proactively detect and address problematic behavior in their deployments. 

You can manage System Insights through an intuitive [Windows Admin Center](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-server/manage/windows-admin-center/overview) extension or [directly through PowerShell](https://aka.ms/SystemInsightsPowerShell), and System Insights allows you to configure each capability separately according to the needs of your deployment, helping you reduce the operational expenses associated with monitoring your Windows Server instances. In Windows Server 2019, System Insights introduces default capabilities focused on capacity forecasting, predicting future resource usage for compute, network, and storage.

## Local functionality
System Insights runs completely locally on Windows Server. Using new functionality introduced in Windows Server 2019, all of your data is collected, persisted, and analyzed directly on your machine, allowing you to realize predictive analytics capabilities without any cloud-connectivity.

Your system data is stored on your machine, and this data is analyzed by predictive capabilities that don't require retraining in the cloud. With System Insights, you can retain your data on your machine and still benefit from advanced analytics capabilities. 


## Get started
### Requirements
System Insights is currently available in Windows Server 2019 Insider Preview Build 17692. 

System Insights runs on any Windows Server 2019 instance. It runs on both host and guest machines, on any hypervisor, and in any cloud.
